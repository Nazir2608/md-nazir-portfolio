                Hi, I'm <strong>{data.name}</strong>, a passionate Java developer 
                based in {data.location}. I specialize in building robust, scalable 
                applications using modern Java technologies and best practices.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                My journey in software development began after my Civil Engineering studies, 
                where I discovered my passion for backend development and problem-solving. 
                Through intensive training and hands-on experience, I've specialized in Java 
                enterprise development, particularly in banking and financial systems.
              </p>

              <p>
                Currently working at Opalina Technologies, I focus on building and maintaining 
                core banking modules that serve thousands of users. I believe in writing clean, 
                efficient code and have experience with real-time production environments, 
                database optimization, and secure transaction processing.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to music, playing cricket, and exploring 
                new technologies. I'm driven by complex challenges and consistently strive for 
                excellence in every task I undertake.
